# web-framework-kata
Web Framework Kata is way to evaluate different Web Frameworks by hands-on experimentation (aka "kicking the tires"). The web app is a classic TODO list that we improve in successive katas. The katas are framework agnostic, and as such, should be doable using any existing web framework, and programming language.
